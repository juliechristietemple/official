		<h1> Life after incarceration </h1>
		<h2>In Philadelphia, an estimated one in six people have been incarcerated. After serving time, people then face the process of reentry: becoming a part of the society they had been isolated from for months, years, or decades. Prisoners typically get little, if any, preparation for this transition or for life on the outside. The only centralized system that directs formerly incarcerated people to the resources they need to build a successful life on the outside is probation and parole, departments whose primary duty is monitoring and controlling behavior. Detention facilities in the US have thus become a revolving door: more likely than not, the released end up back inside.</h2>
		<h2>Still, every day, people are released, determined to beat those odds.</h2>

			<div class="column size-1of3">
				<!-- Mental Health -->
					<div>
						<h3>Mental health</h3>
						<p>According to multiple studies, trauma is the norm among incarcerated people in the United states.</p>
						<p>Seventy three percent of incarcerated women and 55 percent of incarcerated men have at least one mental health problem.</p>
						<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
					</div>
					<!-- Probation and parole -->
					<div>
						<h3>Probation and parole</h3>
						<p>After incarceration, the newly released are subject to an average of 1,070 state rules and regulations including mandatory check-in’s, the ability to vote and family and domestic rights — then add 1,196 federal rules. There are 865 sanctions for formerly incarcerated people in Pennsylvania.</p>
						<p>PO meetings are not necessarily in locations close to the former offender’s home and held during times when people are expected to be at work, taking care of their family or attending appointments like therapy, mental health and medical care.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="bottomline" style=" width:60%; height:1px; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>

			<div class="column size-1of3">
				<!-- Employment -->
					<div>
						<h3>Employment</h3>
						<p>Criminal records make it much more difficult to find a job. It’s estimated that 92 percent of employers in the United States initially screen for criminal backgrounds.</p>
					</div>
					<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
				<!-- Full inclusion in society -->
					<div>
						<h3>Full inclusion in society</h3>
						<p>People with criminal histories often encounter numerous other obstacles that prevent them from becoming full and productive members of society. For example, more than half US states put some restrictions on the voting rights of people who have done time. Formerly incarcerated people often struggle with debt, a lack of financial literacy, and unfamiliarity with basic technology. Mothers and fathers who have been released and want to reunite with their children have to jump through complicated hoops to regain custody. There is also an entrenched stigma that colors the interactions the formerly incarcerated have with others in society on a daily basis.</p>

					<div>
						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>In correctional facilities nationwide, more than half of incarcerated people have not finished high school — that’s 56 percent of inmates in federal prisons, 67 percent of inmates in state prisons, and 69 percent of inmates in local jails.</p>

						<h3>Mental health</h3>
						<p>According to multiple studies, trauma is the norm among incarcerated people in the United states.</p>
						<p>Seventy three percent of incarcerated women and 55 percent of incarcerated men have at least one mental health problem.</p>
						<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>

					<!-- Probation and parole -->
					<div>
						<h3>Probation and parole</h3>
						<p>After incarceration, the newly released are subject to an average of 1,070 state rules and regulations including mandatory check-in’s, the ability to vote and family and domestic rights — then add 1,196 federal rules. There are 865 sanctions for formerly incarcerated people in Pennsylvania.</p>
						<p>PO meetings are not necessarily in locations close to the former offender’s home and held during times when people are expected to be at work, taking care of their family or attending appointments like therapy, mental health and medical care.</p>

						<h3>Employment</h3>
						<p>Criminal records make it much more difficult to find a job. It’s estimated that 92 percent of employers in the United States initially screen for criminal backgrounds.</p>

						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>In correctional facilities nationwide, more than half of incarcerated people have not finished high school — that’s 56 percent of inmates in federal prisons, 67 percent of inmates in state prisons, and 69 percent of inmates in local jails.</p>

				<!-- Full inclusion in society -->
					<div>
						<h3>Full inclusion in society</h3>
						<p>People with criminal histories often encounter numerous other obstacles that prevent them from becoming full and productive members of society. For example, more than half US states put some restrictions on the voting rights of people who have done time. Formerly incarcerated people often struggle with debt, a lack of financial literacy, and unfamiliarity with basic technology. Mothers and fathers who have been released and want to reunite with their children have to jump through complicated hoops to regain custody. There is also an entrenched stigma that colors the interactions the formerly incarcerated have with others in society on a daily basis.</p>

						<h3>Mental health</h3>
						<p>According to multiple studies, trauma is the norm among incarcerated people in the United states.</p>
						<p>Seventy three percent of incarcerated women and 55 percent of incarcerated men have at least one mental health problem.</p>
						<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
					</div>
					<!-- Probation and parole -->
					<div>
						<h3>Probation and parole</h3>
						<p>After incarceration, the newly released are subject to an average of 1,070 state rules and regulations including mandatory check-in’s, the ability to vote and family and domestic rights — then add 1,196 federal rules. There are 865 sanctions for formerly incarcerated people in Pennsylvania.</p>
						<p>PO meetings are not necessarily in locations close to the former offender’s home and held during times when people are expected to be at work, taking care of their family or attending appointments like therapy, mental health and medical care.</p>
					</div>
					<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
					<!-- Employment -->
					<div>
						<h3>Employment</h3>
						<p>Criminal records make it much more difficult to find a job. It’s estimated that 92 percent of employers in the United States initially screen for criminal backgrounds.</p>
					</div>
					<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
					<!-- Education -->
					<div>
						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>In correctional facilities nationwide, more than half of incarcerated people have not finished high school — that’s 56 percent of inmates in federal prisons, 67 percent of inmates in state prisons, and 69 percent of inmates in local jails.</p>
					</div>
					<div style=" width:60%; height:1px; background-color:gray; margin: 25px 0px 25px 0px;"></div>
				<!-- Full inclusion in society -->
					<div>
						<h3>Full inclusion in society</h3>
						<p>People with criminal histories often encounter numerous other obstacles that prevent them from becoming full and productive members of society. For example, more than half US states put some restrictions on the voting rights of people who have done time. Formerly incarcerated people often struggle with debt, a lack of financial literacy, and unfamiliarity with basic technology. Mothers and fathers who have been released and want to reunite with their children have to jump through complicated hoops to regain custody. There is also an entrenched stigma that colors the interactions the formerly incarcerated have with others in society on a daily basis.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">Philadelphia's Fair Chance Hiring Initiative encourages commercial businesses located in Philadelphia to hire formerly incarcerated people by providing a reimbursement of $5 per hour worked by the employee for up to $5,000. This new program replaces a similar tax-incentive introduced in 2006, but virtually no businesses took advantage of the program.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">A $3.5 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation began Philadelphia's attempt to reduce its prison population by 34 percent. Since then, the city's prison population has dropped almost 12 percent. Included in this is an experiment with alternative detainers, through which those under community supervision receive treatment, rather than being locked up, when they violate certain terms of their parole.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">Philadelphia expanded its "Ban the Box" law to make it harder for employers to screen applicants based on their criminal record. Any employers doing business in Philadelphia are not allowed to ask any questions about criminal records on job applications, and can only run a background check after making a conditional offer of employment. The only exemptions are for certain criminal justice agencies and positions that, by federal law, require a consideration of criminal history.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">The Pennsylvania State Senate unanimously passed a bill that would automatically seal criminal records for nonviolent misdemeanors for people who have remained crime-free for 10 years. The legislation still has to be passed in the state's House of Representatives before it becomes policy. Gov. Tom Wolf said he would sign the bill into law.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that in order to sentence a minor to life in prison, prosecutors are required to prove that the minor is unable to be rehabilitated beyond a reasonable doubt. Pennsylvania has the largest juvenile lifer population in the entire country. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that life without parole for minors was unconstitutional, changing Pennsylvania's policy of automatic life without parole for anyone convicted of first or second degree murder.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">The state's Department of Corrections extended its contract with a company that provides video-based visitation for the friends and families of people who are incarcerated. The program helps them save money, as it costs less than a physical trip to the State Correctional Institutions. In December, the contract will expire, but the Department of Correction plans to transition to its own system of virtual visitation by then.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Gov. Tom Wolf announced the Pennsylvania Reentry Council, which will connect the state Department of Corrections, Board of Probation and Parole, the Commission on Crime and Delinquency and more than 21 other regional reentry coalitions and reentry service providers. The Council will be a central way for those organizations to work together to tackle the state's issues with reentry.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">Starting in May, Pennsylvania changed its policy regarding Medicaid coverage for incarcerated people. Instead of their Medicaid coverage getting terminated and forcing them to reapply for coverage after release, returning citizens' coverage is instead suspended during incarceration. This means that upon release, Medicaid coverage should be restored when the correctional facilities process the release paperwork.</p>

					<p style="margin-left: 34px;">State officials announced their plan to reduce the number of jailed Pennsylvanians who have a mental illness. In the coming years, several state departments and the Stepping Up Initiative will examine how people with mental illnesses interact with the criminal justice system and what gets them there. That data collection will serve as the foundation for how to address that population.</p>
